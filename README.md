# WhoKnowsThat

This will be like the board game `Nobody is perfect`. It is a learning project to get in touch with `Fable.ReactNative`, since I already know `Fable` with `React` and I like to develop for mobile devices.

Since I don't have a Mac I cannot prioritize for Apple, so this will be mainly an Android app (for now).

It could be, that this repository goes private. I really don't know what I should do with this by now, so I leave this public. Maybe one or another can learn something by this repository. Probably not, but hey... who knows ;)

Feel free to add some questions (by now there is no multilanguage support and since I am german the language of the questions is german too...)
